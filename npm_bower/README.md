# node_npm_bower
Builds on top of node with nvm. Original repo can work from a mounted shared volume.

This repo copies code and installs npm and bower in production mode before running.

Runs index.js by default, but you can pass your script name as a parameter. Pass bash to enter bash instead of running node.
